# François Vaux

I'm a developer working at [Wyplay][wyplay] where I build Web-based user
interfaces for set-top-boxes and connected TVs.

I'm also a member of [Putain de Code][pbang], a French group of hackers
promoting best practices and teaching to develop better in the langue de
Molière.

You can follow me on [Twitter][tw] or explore my [GitHub][gh] profile.

  as a Git commiter.

  set them up.

  set. Mostly, it remembers your current working directory when opening a new
  window.

  used to build this site!
* [MDR][gh:mdr] is a cool diff viewer for Git for which I built a GTK port for
  Linux.
